This application for this exercise is the same as the one for exercise 2-1, except that the formatting is done with CSS instead of a table. 
This time, the formatting will be the way it is below and the form will be centered in the browser. 
For this exercise, you will start a new web site and add the Default.aspx file and its code-behind file from the application for exercise 2-1.
You will also add the CSS file from the Future Value application. 
Then, you will modify the Default.aspx file so the web site uses CSS for formatting. 
That will help you appreciate how much simpler the aspx code is when you separate the formatting from the content.
